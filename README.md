Laser is a fun, online multiplayer game that can be played with any number of people. Simply join the same room name to get started!
There are 4 moves: charge, beam, forcefield, and atomic.
- You start with 0 charges, and charge lets you gain a charge
- Beam makes you lose a charge and lets you attack another user
- Forcefield blocks against beam and costs 0 charges
- Atomic costs 6 charges and defeats everybody
The game is turnbased, so you cannot see what the others do until everyone moves. Once everyone moves, there are animations that show what happened.
